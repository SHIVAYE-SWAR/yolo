### 🧍 Person Detection
Detects and tracks people in real-time from live webcam or video feeds.

Features:
- Person bounding boxes with labels
- Real-time FPS display
- Optional GUI interface

### 🚗 Car Speed Detection
Detects moving vehicles and calculates their estimated speed using:
- Distance over time estimation
- ROI-based tracking
- Optional unit conversion (km/h, mph)
- Video navigation controls (play, pause, seek)
